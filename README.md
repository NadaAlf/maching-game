# matching game


### The idea of the application:
##### There is two images and you have to match between them to win!

here is an example: 

<div>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120380624/231353393-589b22da-51fe-4760-8843-dd5aff3d1cf3.png" width="250" height="450">
</div>


##### Now you have to press on the images randomly 

##### After many tries: 
<div>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120380624/231354684-f7e68f06-5d29-4915-824c-49e90824417a.png" width="250" height="450">
</div>

#### Congrates!
